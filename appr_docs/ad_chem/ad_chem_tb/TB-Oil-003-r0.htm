<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The physical means that are used for removing water and
solids from oil include several types of filtration, centrifuging and vacuum
dehydration techniques.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom:8" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If vacuum treatment is not employed it is advisable to limit
the temperature to 60<sup>o</sup>C. If vacuum is employed, a higher temperature 
may be advantageous. However, at the vacuum used the initial boiling point of 
that oil should not be exceeded, to avoid undue loss of lighter fractions. If 
this information is not available, it is recommended that the oil should not be 
vacuum treated at temperatures over 70<sup>o</sup>C. See Note below.</font></p>

inhibitors 2,6-di-tert-butyl-paracresol and 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="5"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">phenol, are more
volatile than mineral insulating oil. The selectivity for removal of water and
air in preference to loss of inhibitor and oil is improved by use of a low
processing temperature.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If it is desired to reduce sludge or free water, cold treatment

<b>Filters</b> deal efficiently with solid impurities, but are
generally capable of removing only small quantities of water such as may be
found in oil from equipment housed in buildings. Where relatively large
quantities of water are present, most of it can, and shall, be drained away
before filtration of the oil.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8" dir="ltr"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These are generally based on the principle of forcing oil
under pressure through absorbing material such as paper or other filter media.
Filters of this type are preferentially used in removing contaminants in
suspension. (The filter medium should be capable of removing particles larger
than a nominal 10 &#956;m.) These devices do
not de-gas the oil.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The water-removing ability of a filter is dependent upon the
dryness and quantity of the filter medium. When filtering oil-containing water,
the water content of the filter medium rapidly comes into equilibrium with the
water content of the oil. A continuous indication of the water content of the
outgoing oil is useful to monitor the efficiency of the process.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Care should be taken that paper filters are of the correct

elevated temperature. In one method the treatment is accomplished by spraying
the oil into a vacuum chamber; in the other, the oil flows in thin layers over
series of baffles inside a vacuum chamber. In both types the objective is to
expose maximum surface and minimum thickness of oil to the vacuum.</font></p>

suitable clean containers. When the electrical equipment is to be refilled the
oil is passed through the purifier again, and then directly into the equipment.
This method should be used for switchgear. It is suitable, too, for the smaller
transformer, but care is needed to ensure that the core, the windings, the
interior of the tank and other oil-containing compartments of all equipment
should also well cleaned, by means of oil from the purifier.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The oil is circulated through the purifier, being taken from
the bottom of the tank of the electrical equipment and re-delivered to the top.
The return delivery should be made smoothly and horizontally at or near the top
oil level to avoid, as far as possible, mixing cleaned oil with oil which has
not yet passed through the purifier. The circulation method is particularly
useful for removing suspended contaminants, but adhering contaminants will not necessarily be removed.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Experience has shown that it is generally necessary to pass
the total volume of oil through the purifier not less than three times, and
equipment of appropriate capacity should be chosen with this in mind. The final
number of cycles will depend on the degree of contamination, and it is essential
that the process be continued until a sample taken from the bottom of the
electrical equipment, after the oil has been allowed to settle for a few hours,
pass the breakdown voltage test.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The circulation should be performed with the electrical
equipment disconnected from the power source, and this is essential when using a
purifier which aerates the oil in all cases, and especially when aeration has
occurred, the oil should be allowed to stand for some time in accordance with
the manufacture’s instructions before the equipment is re-energized.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 8"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Another technique is sometimes used for transformers, in
which oil is continuously circulated during normal service through an adsorbent,
such as molecular sieve, thus keeping both oil and windings dry and removing
many oil oxidation products; this is a specialized method not further considered
in this guide.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
