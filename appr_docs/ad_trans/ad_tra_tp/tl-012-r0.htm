  <li>A pump to draw waters from the tank and drives it through the hose with a

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="5">Work to be Carried Out</font></p>
</b>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The supervisor should specify the
    proper position of each piece of equipment especially the telescopic vehicle
    as illustrated in figure 1. He should also identify the work sequence on
    each phase according to the wind speed and direction, as mentioned in safety
    precautions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Work must proceed depending on the
    wind direction so that the water would flow avoiding any water splash on the
    insulators, which aren’t cleaned yet.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Washing of tension towers insulators
    is usually completed as the telescope is moved along 8 Positions as in
    Figure 2. Start the washing process at the farthest insulator in the
    direction of wind given that water must flow in a direction opposite to that
    of the wind to avoid any splash of water on the insulators yet to be
    cleaned.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Place the telescope vehicle and the
    rest of equipment at the line comprising location no. 1 at a distance of 15
    m from the towers axis given that it is the farthest line in wind direction
    as for the telescope vehicle it must be placed at location no. 1. (i.e. 6.5
    m away from each phase).</font></li>
</ol>
</font>
<ol start="5">
  <li>The telescopic vehicle jacks must be lowered to the ground, and the earth
    cables of the equipment are connected to the tower legs. The hose attached
    to the water pump must also be connected to the telescope.</li>
  <li>The washing technician must climb to the basket of the vehicle. raised and
    leveled to the ground and the telescope pillar is then raised taking into
    consideration that its inclination from the main axis must not exceed three
    degrees. Also take care that its height must not exceed than:</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ul>
    <li>12 to 13 meters in the case of tension towers type A</li>
    <li>17 to 18 meters in the case of tension towers type A+5</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In both cases, the length of the water column must never
    be less than 8m in length, and the height of the telescope must make it
    possible for the washing technician to have a full view of all three
    insulator strings in a parallel position.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7">
  <li>Turn on the water pump when the washing technician gives a starting signal
    to the work supervisor. Then the cleaning process will takes place by
    washing the first half insulators strings of phase A, facing the High Dam,
    which are insulators no 1, 2, 3 consecutively (the insulators strings are
    numbered according to the numeration of the High Dam - Cairo Line 500KV as
    illustrated in document no. TD-TL-004- -r0. The water stream must flow
    starting from the conductor towards the towers body to the midpoint of the
    insulator string, and three or four disks of the three strings are washed
    consecutively till half the disks are cleaned taking into consideration that
    each 30 disks are cleaned in 40 seconds.</li>
  <li>Turn off the water pump when the washing technician gives a stopping
    signal to the supervisor. The supervisor must ensure that all insulators are
    well cleaned using field glasses from a spot where it is possible for him to
    see all the insulator disks.</li>
  <li>Wash the insulators no. 4, 5, 6 at location no. 2 similar to insulators no
    1, 2, 3 at location no.1 following the previous procedures and taking into
    consideration the same Safety Precautions used before.</li>
  <li>Washing the no. 2-1, 3-1, 4 Loop suspension insulators string of phases A,
    B, C facing the High Dam must take place at sites 2, 3, 4 consecutively
    given that the water column must be moved upwards along those strings from
    the conductor up to the towers top.</li>
  <li>After washing all the insulators facing the High Dam, the taps of the pump
    and the tank must be turned off and the hose disconnected from the vehicle.
    All earthing cables that hinder the transfer of equipment must also be
    disconnected and equipment are then moved slowly, (i.e. with a velocity not
    more than 4 km/hour), to the other side of the tower (that facing Cairo)</li>
  <li>Insulators strings facing Cairo direction must washed from sites no 5, 6,
    7, 8 consecutively. Taking the same steps and precautions except for the
    direction of the water column movement, as it must be moved along the
    tension strings in a direction opposite to that of the wind according to the
    common rule.</li>
  <li>After washing all the towers insulators mentioned in the work order, taps
    of the pump and the tank must be turned off, the hose and the earthing
    cables be disconnected. Then the equipment moved away from the towers outer
    phase by 25 m, then the telescope is then restored to its initial position
    to be moved to another tower taking into consideration that the vehicles
    must not be moved under the energized lines conductors.</li>
